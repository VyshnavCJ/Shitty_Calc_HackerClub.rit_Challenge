# Shitty_Calc_HackerClub.rit_Challenge
This Program is made for the Hackerclub Challege . This program execute a Simple calculator is Shittiest way possible. Hope you blow your mind By seeing this.

In this program I just added 4 operations +,-,/,x only, Modulus operator is not added beacuse it is a simple Calculator. 

Addision
The logic of addition is we can only add 1 to a number, so i made some tweek so it will add any number.The printing method is different You will see when you run the code.
Note: Plz dont add Big numbers because I used Sleep fuction to slow down the Output so that you can easly under stand the working.(range 1- 30).do not enter negative values (eg -7).

Subtraction
The logic of Division is we can split the number which is should to be subtracted from in equal parts of the number that is going to subtract the number and remove one quantiy of that equal part. I know you don't understand it so see for yourself.
Note: Plz dont use big numbers I used sleep function here also(range 1 - 50). You can subtract large num from small also. do not enter negative values (eg -7).

Division
This one is Complex so I cant clearly explain the logic.The Divident is split to different digits and stored in an array the Divisor is multiplied by natural numbers untill it exceed the one digit.The natural number which multipled the number before exceeding is consider as first digit of quotient if Reminder present it will combine with next digit in the array, this process go on untill array gets empty.IF you dont understant the execution see for your self.
Note: you can use big number as you like.

Multiplication
This one is intresting I created a predefined multiplication table using array . The number you enter will consider as index for the array.do not enter negative values (eg -7).


Big Note: you can enter invalid value in the program so you can see what i done for such cases. I only recomend not to input negative numbers where numbers are asked, rather than that you can do what ever you want!
ENJOY MY SHITTY CALCULATOR :)
